# Passion-Project (Vue.js Showcase Portfolio)
**Project Description:**
I created this website for a school project called the Passion Project, in this period we get a few weeks to create something that fits out professional identity.
Since i want to become a front-end web developer i decided to create a showcase portfolio for myself, where people can gather info on who i am, what ive created so far, and check my CV. I am also going to create this using Vue.js, a framework i have never worked with before, this is because i want to learn to work with frameworks as im sure it will be valuable later on.

**How to Install and Run the Project:**
Because i have already turned the code into a working build you can simply download the 'dist' map, it contains an index.html, a css, js and images map. Once you upload these files to your webserver the website should work as long as javascript is enabled. if you wish to use seperate components you can simple download these from the repository and use them in your own project.

**How to use the project:**
This website was created as purpose to show off my skills, cv, and projects ive worked on when i look for internships. So if you are looking for such a website, feel free to edit and use it for yourself.
